                    <p><h3>World, Meet Infusion 1.0</h3>
The Fluid community shipped <a href="http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/">Infusion 1.0</a> a couple of weeks ago. Before making a splash with announcements about the release, we wanted to take some time to revisit our documentation and sample code to be sure they are really useful and comprehensive. Recognizing that it&#39;s not enough just to ship a bundle of code, we try to provide a <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation">whole package of resources</a> for developers and designers who are using Infusion. That means comprehensive API pages, tutorials to get you started, and concepts documentation to give you insights into the philosophy and design patterns we&#39;ve built into Infusion. With this new documentation in place, now&#39;s the time to share the news of Infusion 1.0&#39;s release more widely.</p>
<p>Fluid Infusion is an <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Framework">application framework</a> for building usable and accessible user interfaces with JavaScript. Built on top of <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, Infusion takes a different approach to client-side development. At heart, Infusion is an open architecture designed to put you back in control of your application&#39;s user experience. It includes a <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Components">growing collection of UI components</a>—reusable interactions that go deeper than most widgets.  Created by a community of developers and interaction designers, Infusion components are built from the ground up with accessibility in mind. All of our designs can be used with assistive technologies, are fully controllable with the keyboard, and can be transformed to suit your users&#39; personal needs.</p>
<p>Knowing that you can&#39;t bottle good design, our components can be easily adapted and reworked to suit your creativity. We give you the ability to tweak more than just a few stylesheets—you can totally change the markup of a component, change its behaviour, or toss your own workflow and logic into the mix.</p>
<p><h3>What&#39;s an Application Framework?</h3>
Most JavaScript libraries fit into two categories: foundation toolkits and application frameworks. Foundation toolkits are probably the most familiar, providing all the basic tools required to manipulate the DOM, manage events, and make Ajax calls in a reliable, cross-browser way. <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a> are probably the best-known examples. Application frameworks, on the other hand, have emerged more recently. With more complex interactions and more application logic moving from the server to the client, there is a need for tools to help manage growing code bases. Application frameworks such as <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com/">Sproutcore</a> and <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org/">Dojo + Dojox</a> often provide features such as data binding, support for the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ModelViewController">Model-View-Controller</a> pattern, and HTML template rendering.</p>
<p>Infusion puts a unique spin on things: it takes a <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Declarative+Configuration">declarative</a> and <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Event+System">event-driven</a> approach, promoting less code and greater flexibility. Built on top of jQuery, everything about Infusion is open: its architecture, source code, and community. Our approach to Model-View-Controller is different, too. <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Model+Objects">Models</a> and <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Component+Lifecycle">views</a> are at the heart of Infusion, while controller code is conspicuously absent. Unlike most MVC web frameworks, we think it&#39;s the job of the framework to take care of the glue, leaving you to focus on the stuff that makes your application tick.</p>
<p>Infusion&#39;s client-side <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Renderer">template renderer</a> is completely unobtrusive, allowing you to dynamically render your user interface without having to mix up bits of code with your HTML. No code in your templates means more reuse, less chance for mistakes, and an easier job when it comes time to do a redesign. We also include a <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+Skinning+System+(FSS)">lightweight CSS framework</a> that lets you mix and match styles to create beautiful and themeable user interfaces, providing pre-baked layouts, widgets and text styles to get you started. We even give you plugins and framework APIs to help ease the burden of creating user interfaces with JavaScript that will be accessible to a wide range of users.</p>
<p>Interoperability is huge for Infusion. We play nice with other JavaScript code, avoiding the conflicts that are common when combining different JavaScript libraries. This makes Infusion particularly well suited to building mashups, portals, and content management systems.</p>
<p><h3>Fluid and jQuery</h3>
We love jQuery. Infusion wouldn&#39;t have been possible without the simplicity and clarity of jQuery&#39;s approach. We also didn&#39;t want to reinvent the wheel, so jQuery is everywhere in Infusion. Recognizing that some applications need more, we created Infusion to complement jQuery and other JavaScript libraries. It&#39;s not an either/or situation—Infusion is very modular, so you can pick and choose the features you need based on the complexity of your project. Go ahead and combine ordinary jQuery code with Infusion, or use the whole framework whenever you need robust data binding, unobtrusive markup generation, and MVC-style designs.</p>
<p>Fluid&#39;s culture of collaboration and interoperability run deep. To that end, we are active contributors to jQuery UI, <a href="http://www.marcozehe.de/2009/03/07/jquery-ui-17-released/">sharing our accessibility experience and code</a> to help make jQuery even better. Every time we come up with a new accessibility improvement, we share it back with jQuery so that the whole community can benefit.</p>
<p><h3>What&#39;s Next?</h3>
This is just the beginning. With Infusion 1.0 out the door, we&#39;ve got lots of new features and improvements on deck. Indeed, the past few weeks have been packed with tweaks, bug fixes, and  features <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Fluid+1.1+Release+Status">destined for the Infusion 1.1 release</a>. We&#39;re planning to ship this next release in early June. Beyond that, we&#39;ll continue to grow our components and add new features to the framework.</p>
<p>We&#39;re also active users of Infusion, building applications and helping other open source communities with their user interfaces. To this end, the Fluid community is embarking on a new project called <a href="http://www.fluidproject.org/projects/fluid-engage/">Fluid Engage</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://fluidproject.org/partners/fluid-engage-partners/">museums and art galleries</a>. We&#39;ll be working alongside curators, education departments, and exhibit designers to help create mobile-friendly open Web solutions that bring a new level of interactivity and visitor engagement to the museum. Infusion will be the backbone of this effort, and Engage will undoubtedly drive new components and framework features back into Infusion. Keep an eye out for things like new mobile themes for the Fluid Skinning System, designed to provide a natural user experience and to repurpose content for mobile devices like the iPhone. We&#39;ll also be shipping a new visualization library for Infusion, providing Canvas-based solutions for drawing rich, vector-based images and animations. If any of these features interests you, don&#39;t hesitate to <a href="http://fluidproject.org/getinvolved/">drop us a line</a> if you&#39;d like to lend a hand.</p>
<p><h3>Give it a Spin and Let Us Know</h3>
We&#39;re really excited to share Infusion with everyone. With the 1.0 release, Infusion offers a stable and reliable solution for building rich user experiences, supported by a dedicated and friendly community. We&#39;ve got a healthy roadmap moving forward, and a growing community of users. With accessibility and usability baked in from the start, we&#39;ve got you covered. <a href="http://fluidproject.org/products/infusion/">Download the release</a>, <a href="http://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Infusion+Documentation">check out the documentation</a>, dive in, and <a href="http://fluidproject.org/getinvolved/">let us know what you think</a>!</p>
